            Meteoroids are stony or metallic debris that travels through outer space – some directed to Earth. Meteoroids are smaller than asteroids and contain less water and ice than comets.

            In terms of location, meteoroids are way out in our solar system. They aren’t in Earth’s atmosphere and they haven’t

            Because meteoroids are in the solar system, they can interfere with spacecraft operations. This is why NASA’s Meteoroid Environment Office (MEO) considers the risk of meteoroids beyond Earth’s orbit.

The meteorites fell into an elliptic area (strewnfield) oriented north–south with height about 12.5 kilometres (7.8 mi) and width 4.8 kilometres (3.0 mi), into Stonařov and neighbouring villages (among them Otín, Cerekvička-Rosice, Dlouhá Brtnice, Hladov, Stará Říše). </p>

                        <p className="card-text">The fall of the meteorite was possibly recorded by the meteorite researcher Ernst Florens Friedrich Chladni : In 1819 Chladni wrote that "1807, August 9, at 8 o'clock in the evening, a fireball moving south east of Nuremberg was noticed". [1] Time and direction of the Untermässing meteorite would fit Chladni's notes.Its repository, the Luitpoldhaus in Nuremberg , which housed the Museum of the Natural History Society , was destroyed in World War II. Three years after the end of the war, the meteorite buried in the basement was rediscovered and salvaged by members of the association. Fortunately, the heat of the building fire had not damaged the structure of the metal.</p>

The Seres meteorite that is also referred to as the ‘Macedonia’ and the ‘Serrai’ meteorite. It is the first and only documented meteorite to have fallen in Greece.

                            Exact data about the recovery and the impact of the meteorite are not known or are vague. However, almost three decades later after its fall, the main mass of the meteorite landed in the Natural History Museum in Vienna where has been kept together with thousand of meteorites until now.</p>

                        <p className="card-text">After the appearance of a fireball accompanied by detonations, a shower of over 100 stones fell. 24 stones were recovered, the largest with a mass of 1.571 kg. Most recovered stones were complete and usually covered with a largely intact and blackish fusion crust. A few grayish chondrules (PO, BO, RP) and grains of Fe-Ni metal and troilite are set within a grey and white matrix. Olivine (Fa19) and low Ca-orthopyroxene are characteristic of the H-chondrite geochemical group. Mineralogically, dominant olivine and low-Ca pyroxene are accompanied by minor troilite and Fe-Ni metal (kamacite, taenite). Accessory chromite, copper, and other minor opaques are also reported. Shock indicators include a number of veins and twinned prismatic Ca-poor clinopyroxene.</p>

                        <p className="card-text">A shower of stones fell with ~25 kg being recovered almost immediately and another ~25 kg recovered later. The Krymka meteorite is an unusual unequilibrated ordinary chondrite which has received considerable additional attention in recent years. As with other unequilibrated ordinary chondrites, Krymka possesses abundant, distinct chondrules [porphyritic olivine (PO) and porphyritic olivine-pyroxene (POP) chondrules are especially prominent] embedded in a matrix with additional olivine and pyroxene grains and clasts, Fe-Ni metal, troilite, and other minor opaques. The olivine is highly unequilibrated with chondrule olivine usually more forsteritic [Fa0-24] and matrix olivine more compositionally varied [Fa6-92].</p>

A large stone of about 800 g fell in the Aeritalia parking (the aerospace company Aeritalia nowadays is named Thales Alenia Space Italia) in Corso Marche, City of Turin, a foot away from a parked car and was immediately recovered [It is curious that the company produces also impact shields to protect spacecrafts from meteorites and orbital debris].The largest fragment of this stone, A (Aeritalia), has a mass of 452 g.
Three smaller stones were later recovered at Pianezza (27 g) and in the Collegno municipal territory, namely in Collegno town (50 g) and at Villaggio Leumann (100 g), in a roughly triangular area of 18 km2.</p>

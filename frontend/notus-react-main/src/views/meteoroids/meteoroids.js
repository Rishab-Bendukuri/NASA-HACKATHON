            <h2>Meteoroids</h2>
            <p className=''>
            Meteoroids are stony or metallic debris that travels through outer space – some directed to Earth. Meteoroids are smaller than asteroids and contain less water and ice than comets.

            In terms of location, meteoroids are way out in our solar system. They aren’t in Earth’s atmosphere and they haven’t

            Because meteoroids are in the solar system, they can interfere with spacecraft operations. This is why NASA’s Meteoroid Environment Office (MEO) considers the risk of meteoroids beyond Earth’s orbit.

            <h2>Composition</h2>
            <p>
            Almost all meteoroids contain extraterrestrial nickel and iron. They have three main classifications: iron, stone, and stony-iron. Some stone meteoroids contain grain-like inclusions known as chondrules and are called chondrites. Stony meteoroids without these features are called "achondrites", which are typically formed from extraterrestrial igneous activity; they contain little or no extraterrestrial iron.[17] The composition of meteoroids can be inferred as they pass through Earth's atmosphere from their trajectories and the light spectra of the resulting meteor. Their effects on radio signals also give information, especially useful for daytime meteors, which are otherwise very difficult to observe. From these trajectory measurements, meteoroids have been found to have many different orbits, some clustering in streams (see meteor showers) often associated with a parent comet, others apparently sporadic. Debris from meteoroid streams may eventually be scattered into other orbits. The light spectra, combined with trajectory and light curve measurements, have yielded various compositions and densities, ranging from fragile snowball-like objects with density about a quarter that of ice,[18] to nickel-iron rich dense rocks. The study of meteorites also gives insights into the composition of non-ephemeral meteoroids.
